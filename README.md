# My Bash Config

Setup notes, use README on the master branch as the single source of truth.

## Setup for Mac

```sh
cd ~
touch .bash_profile // Source .bashrc here
touch .bashrc
```

## Setup for Windows 10

Since Windows now automatically read `.bash_profile` on boot, add the following commands in `.bash_profile` to check for `.bashrc` file,

```sh
cd ~ # .bash_profile located here
```

within `.bash_profile` add following script,

```sh
# generated by Git for Windows
test -f ~/.profile && . ~/.profile
test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
```

within `.bashrc` add following script (create `.bashrc` in the same folder of the `.bash_profile` manually if file not exist),

```sh
# Source my bashrc file location
source /c/Users/bugma/WorkBashrc/.DHbashrc
```
